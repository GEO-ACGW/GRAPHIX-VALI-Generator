ðŸ›  Simple Vali Tool. No Coding Needed
This tool allows you to easily generate from Vali JSON files or update without command line. It's designed for users with zero programming experience, or for map makers who just want to speed up the process.

Want to build or tweak a config quickly? This tool has you covered.

I've included the original .py file if you'd like to run or modify it yourself.

For everyone else, there's a precompiled .exe release  just download it and start genning right away!
